# Database-Online-Clothing-Store
Database Designed Online Clothing Store

This project creates a database using the schema.sql in the SQL folder. This database has 5 tables, Clothing, users, Supplier, 
Purchased Items, and ShoppingCart. This was programmed using Netbeans and ran on the glassfish server. Images of the website
are provided in the websiteScreenshots folder.

This project combines database design and website design.

The website allows users to register, login, and go through the different pages and add items to their shopping cart, and then 
confirm the purchase. There is a page that only "Employees" can enter (this is designated in the users table), this is the "PurchasedItems.jsp" page which displays a table of every item purchased (username who bought them, product id, and price).
